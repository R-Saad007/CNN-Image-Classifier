Accuracy tends to increase with increase in number of epochs (direct)
Accuracy tends to decrease with increase in batch_size (inverse)
Adam optimizer performs well but takes alot of time (600 seconds on 5 epochs with a batch_size of 5)
SGD optimizer is a compromise for the accuracy with speed (116 seconds on 5 epochs with a batch_size of 5)
The model tends to perform with an accuracy of 60%+ with batch_size = 4 and epochs = 5 (best)
Dropout layers reduce accuracy as they prevent overfitting
